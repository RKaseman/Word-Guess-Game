[Hedonometer Hangman](https://rkaseman.github.io/unit-03-game-word-guess/)

- [x] Browser-based game
- [x] JavaScript updates both:
  - [x] HTML
  - [x] CSS
- [x] Choose a theme (Classic Hangman)
- [x] Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type
- [ ] Display the following on the page
  - [ ] Press any key to get started
  - [ ] Wins (haven't decided about this)
  - [ ] Number of Guesses Remaining (not doing this since the hangman animation is its own score)
  - [ ] Letters Already Guessed (may or may not do this since the game says a letter was already picked when repeated)
  - [ ] After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it (will be chosen from 3 Hedonometer data results)
#
### Nice-to-haves added

I always keep RWD and media queries in mind.

This project isn't far enough complete visually to worry about them yet.

This is my first use of CSS variables.
